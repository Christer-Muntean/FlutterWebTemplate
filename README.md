# Flutter Web Template - Firebase Auth

###### Remember to create a Firebase project, and add the script to index.html
###### Also remember to implement this configuratuion: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/url-strategies


## Features
- ###### FlutterFire
- ###### Nullsafety
- ###### Provider/Changenotifier
- ###### PathUrl strategy

When using Flutter Web with null-safety you will experience the following crash
```Error: Expected a value of type 'Object', but got one of type 'Null'```
There doesn't seem to be a fix for it atm, but at least it doesn't impact the app.
