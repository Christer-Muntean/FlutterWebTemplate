# Flutter Web Template - Firebase Auth

### TODO:

- ###### Add web support to an existing app. Run the following command from your project‚Äôs directory:
```flutter create .```

- ###### Create a Firebase project, add the script to index.html, and enable Google authentication.
- ###### Implement this configuratuion: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/url-strategies


### Features
- ###### FlutterFire
- ###### Nullsafety
- ###### Provider/Changenotifier
- ###### PathUrl strategy

When using Flutter Web with null-safety you will experience the following crash
```Error: Expected a value of type 'Object', but got one of type 'Null'```
There doesn't seem to be a fix for it atm, but at least it doesn't impact the app.
